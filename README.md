# EconSpace

**A 2D EVE-like space MMO with an authoritative client–server core, built in C++ on top of [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).**

You pilot a ship in a persistent, multi-system galaxy: mine, trade, run missions, fight, and build reputation with factions — while the galaxy simulates itself around you. The world lives on an authoritative server; the client renders snapshots and sends commands. There is no single-player mode — playing means running (or connecting to) a server.

> **Project status — honest version.** EconSpace is an engineering-driven **prototype**, not a finished game. The client–server architecture and netcode are solid and real; the *content* is not: sprites are placeholder shapes (no art yet), there is no audio, and the world is small. The server currently accepts **one** client at a time — multi-client is the next foundational piece, not an extra. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for where it is and where it's going. Contributions are very welcome.

## What's in it

EconSpace runs its own game logic on top of raylib (windowing/render/input only). The authoritative `Simulation` runs headless in `econserver`; the client is a renderer and an input source. There is one mode — connected play — and everything below already works today.

**Gameplay**
- Newtonian-ish flight, warp travel, autopilot, and a parallax starfield.
- Mining, a station market (buy/sell with price impact and recovery), and ship refits.
- Weapons and combat shared by the player and NPCs (anyone can fight anyone).
- Missions: bounty, mining, and delivery — with a station job board and a journal.
- Factions, reputation tiers, wanted levels/bounties, and role-based NPC AI (trader, miner, police, pirate, warship).
- A multi-system galaxy connected by jump gates, with a full-screen star map.

**Simulation & world**
- An authoritative `Simulation` core with a fixed `1/60` tick, decoupled from rendering.
- A "living galaxy": every system is simulated (system controllers, gate-line economy, territory captures, an event feed) — visible on the galaxy map.
- Persistent systems and agents with stable ids.

**Tooling**
- A visual **world editor** (`worldeditor`) for editing systems and galaxy links, saved to JSON.
- A **headless server** (`econserver`) that runs the exact same simulation without a window.
- An **MCP agent bridge** (`econagent`): an ordinary TCP game client plus an MCP server on stdio. It exposes observation, standing orders, route planning, an event journal, and a scripted end-to-end self-test.

**Networking**
- A `Command` / `Snapshot` / `SystemLayout` protocol over a swappable transport (`ITransport`): TCP (winsock) for play, plus an in-process `LocalTransport` used as a **test** seam by the `econserver hosttest` smoke test and the doctest suite.
- Every wire message is versioned; incompatible protocol versions are rejected instead of silently decoding to defaults.
- Client-side prediction + server reconciliation with input replay for the player's own ship, and entity interpolation for everyone else (the classic [Gambetta](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) model).
- Server-authoritative combat, docking, trading, missions, and player accounts.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how it all fits together.

Local fork changes are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Where it's going

This section describes the remaining work; shipped items are noted explicitly. Details and sequencing live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

- **An MMO, not a sandbox with an optional server.** The client always talks to an authoritative server. Multi-client (one session, ship, and account per connection, plus interest management) is foundational work, not a stretch goal.
- **Glyphs as the primary look** (#36). ASCII/glyph presentation becomes the game's actual visual language rather than a debug view: it closes the art gap honestly, it lets players build structures without an artist in the loop, and the same projection is what an AI agent reads. Sprites stay possible as an alternative rendering backend instead of being the thing that blocks the project.
- **AI agents as first-class players** (#42) — **agent MVP shipped.** `econagent` is a C++ MCP server and ordinary TCP client using the same protocol as a human player. It can observe, issue high-level standing orders, plan routes and wait for events. Fleet command over several agent-piloted ships remains blocked on multi-client support.
- **A player-mutable world** (#44). Players build deployables and structures that feed the macro simulation that already exists — prosperity, security, territory control.

Still missing are multi-client sessions and interest management, the glyph presentation layer, and authoritative player world mutation. The game remains a prototype: rendering uses placeholder shapes, the world is small, and the server currently accepts one connected game client at a time.

## Build & run

**Requirements**
- A C++17 compiler — MinGW-w64 g++ (from [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)).
- CMake 3.16+.
- Internet on the first build: [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) 5.5 and [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) 3.11.3 are fetched and built automatically via CMake `FetchContent`.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"   # configure (first build downloads & builds deps — slow)
cmake --build build                        # build game, server, agent, launcher, editor and tests

ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure # run the unit tests (doctest)
```

> On Windows, close the running game/editor window before rebuilding — Windows won't let you overwrite a running `.exe`. The `data/` folder is copied next to each executable on every build.

**Play** — start a server, then connect a client to it. Both halves are required; the client is not a game on its own.

```sh
# terminal 1 — start an authoritative server on a TCP port
./build/bin/server/econserver.exe host 50800

# terminal 2 — connect a client to it
./build/bin/game/econspace.exe connect 127.0.0.1 50800
```

The server accepts one client at a time for now. Run it on `127.0.0.1` for solo play, or on a reachable host to play over a network.

**Other executables**

```sh
./build/bin/launcher/econlauncher.exe      # graphical launcher: connect or host locally
./build/bin/editor/worldeditor.exe         # visual world editor (systems, objects, galaxy links)
./build/bin/server/econserver.exe          # batch headless simulation (no client, prints galaxy stats)
./build/bin/server/econserver.exe hosttest # server-loop smoke test over the in-process transport
./build/bin/agent/econagent.exe connect 127.0.0.1 50800  # MCP server on stdio
./build/bin/agent/econagent.exe selftest 127.0.0.1 50800 # scripted agent smoke test
```

## Repository layout

```
data/                 the game world as JSON (systems, galaxy index) — not hard-coded
src/
  engine/             shared core (static lib): world, entities, factions, UI, render
  game/               the game client + the authoritative Simulation + headless server
  agent/              MCP bridge: an ordinary TCP game client for an AI agent
  launcher/           graphical server / connection launcher
  editor/             the visual world editor
tests/                doctest unit tests (protocol / TCP round-trips)
documents/            design docs (concept, world format, factions/AI, living galaxy, assets)
```

The code is split into three modules — **engine** (shared static library), **game**, and **editor**. `game` and `editor` link `engine`; `engine` never depends on them.
